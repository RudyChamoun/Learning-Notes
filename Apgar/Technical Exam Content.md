	The JOIN has 3 forms, JOIN / LEFT JOIN / RIGHT JOIN 
	
		- The JOIN keyword selects all rows from both the tables as long as the condition is satisfied ! So it will give me results from table1 and table2 that meet the given condition
		ex : SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....  
			FROM table1 JOIN table2  
			ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;

		- The LEFT JOIN returns all the rows of the table on the left side of the join and matches rows for the table on the right side of the join. For the rows for which there is no matching row on the right side, the result-set will containÂ null.
		ex : SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....  
			FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2  
			ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;
