## <u>Intro to JavaScript</u>

- In backend development, JavaScript (often referred to as Node.js) is used to write server-side code that runs on the server rather than in the browser
- It is powered by ==Node.js==, a runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server.
- With Node.js, we can use JavaScript to build scalable, high-performance server-side applications.

## <u>How JavaScript Interacts with the Server</u>


- **Handling HTTP Requests**: Node.js provides built-in modules like `http` or popular frameworks like ==Express.js to handle HTTP== requests and responses. Developers can define [[Routes]] and[[Middleware]] to process incoming requests and generate responses.

- **Accessing Databases**: JavaScript in the backend can interact with databases such as MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL using database drivers or ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) like Mongoose.

- **Business Logic**: Backend JavaScript code implements the application's business logic, including data processing, authentication, authorization, and other server-side operations.

- **Responding to Clients**: After processing requests, JavaScript sends responses back to clients, typically in the form of JSON data for API endpoints or rendered HTML for web pages.
