## <u>What is a Middleware</u>

- In backend development, middleware refers to functions or pieces of code that run in between the receiving of an HTTP request and the sending of an HTTP response.(after establishing the route, before the handler goes to work)
- Middleware functions have access to the request and response objects, as well as the next function in the application's request-response cycle.
- Middleware functions can perform various tasks such as logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, and more.


## <u>Execution Flow</u>

- Middleware functions are executed sequentially in the order they are defined in the application's code.
- Each middleware function has access to the request (`req`) and response (`res`) objects, as well as the `next` function, which passes control to the next middleware function in the stack.


## <u>Common uses</u>

- <b>Authentication</b>: Middleware functions can check if a request is authenticated before allowing access to protected routes or resources.
- **Logging**: Middleware functions can log details about incoming requests, including request method, URL, headers, and payloads, for debugging or monitoring purposes.
- **Data Parsing**: Middleware functions can parse incoming request bodies (e.g., JSON, form data) and make the parsed data available to subsequent handlers.
- **Error Handling**: Middleware functions can catch errors that occur during request processing and handle them gracefully, returning appropriate error responses to clients.
