## <u>What are Routes </u>

- In backend development, especially when using frameworks like Express.js in JavaScript, routes refer to the mechanism of ==mapping HTTP requests== to specific functions or handlers that process those requests.

- Routes define the endpoints of a web application, specifying the URLs that clients can request and how the server should respond to those requests.

## <u>Request Handling</u>

- When a client sends an HTTP request to a specific URL, the Express.js server matches the request to the corresponding route based on the HTTP method and URL pattern.
- Once a route is matched, the handler function associated with that route is executed to process the request.
- The handler function typically performs tasks such as fetching data from a database, processing the request payload, and generating an appropriate response to send back to the client.


## <u>Middleware and Chained Routing</u>
- Express.js also supports [[Middleware]] functions, which are functions that execute before the route handler. Middleware functions can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, input validation, etc.
- Routes can be organized using route handlers and middleware in a chained manner, allowing for modular and maintainable code.
