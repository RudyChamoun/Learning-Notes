<u>  What is HTML ? </u>

- HTML, which stands for ==Hyper Text Markup Language==, is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a web page by using various tags and elements to define different parts of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

- HTML content is served statically or generated dynamically by server-side languages like 
	PHP and Java. (server-side language generates html but does not render it ! The browser receives the html as a response from the server and then renders the page)
	

<u> General Structure of a Web Page </u>

- The following elements are part of every web page :
`<html>`
	`<head>`
			`<title> What appears in title of page</title>`
	`</head>`
		`<body>`
			`html content .....`
		`</body>`
`</html>`
